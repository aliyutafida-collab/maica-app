Please fix my mobile UI layout. Here are the exact tasks:
	1.	Fix the Login Screen Layout
	•	Wrap the entire login screen in SafeAreaView.
	•	Center the MaiCa logo and text properly on all devices (no shifting).
	•	Ensure all containers use responsive width:
width: '90%' and alignSelf: 'center'.
	•	Remove any hard-coded margins or pixel values that break layout on iPhones.
	2.	General UI Cleanup Across All Screens
	•	Apply a global uniform padding:
paddingHorizontal: 16, paddingTop: 20.
	•	Standardize font sizes and spacing.
	•	Ensure header titles never overlap or shift.
	•	Fix the tab bar icons so they are not squeezed or floating.
	3.	Fix the Products Page
	•	It currently doesn’t load — please fix the navigation route + component import.
	•	Make sure “Add Product” opens the correct form.
	•	Add low stock detection (quantity threshold = 5 by default).
	4.	Fix Authentication Issues
	•	Replace all occurrences of placeholders like auth.name with the actual user object.
	•	Add strong password validation:
	•	Minimum 8 characters
	•	Must include a number
	•	Must include uppercase
	•	Must include a symbol
	•	Display meaningful error messages.
	5.	Fix Multilingual System
	•	Restore all previous languages (English, French, Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo).
	•	Make sure switching a language updates:
	•	Dashboard labels
	•	Buttons
	•	Settings
	•	Subscription pages
	•	Learning pages
	•	Fix all translation keys like more.title, dashboard.sales, etc.
	6.	Add a “Financial Learning” Section
	•	Re-add the basic financial management learning page we agreed earlier.
	•	Ensure content is translatable into all languages.
	7.	Subscription System
	•	Apply 60-day free trial for new users.
	•	Add two tiers:
	•	₦2,500/month – Basic
	•	₦5,000/month – Premium
	•	Add Paystack + Flutterwave integration placeholders.
	8.	Fix the Error Screen
	•	The “Something went wrong” screen appears randomly.
Replace incorrect theme/font usage to prevent the crash.
	9.	Improve Splash + Logo
	•	Increase MaiCa logo size by 30%.
	•	Ensure it is centered on all screens and looks crisp.

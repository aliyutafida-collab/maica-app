Hi Agent — please continue the MaiCa mobile app upgrade with the following required tasks. Everything below must be implemented and all bugs fixed:

1) **Fix Products Page**
- The Products screen currently fails to load. Debug the component and fix all runtime errors.
- Ensure product list loads correctly from storage/API.
- Ensure Add Product opens a form that saves product name, SKU, quantity, cost price, selling price, category, and tax rate.

2) **Low Stock Notification**
- Add a “Low Stock” system:
  - Add a user-configurable low-stock threshold (default 5 units).
  - If any product.stock <= threshold, show:
    • red badge on Products tab  
    • a card on Dashboard saying “Low stock items”  
    • a notification icon in header  
  - Create a dedicated “Low Stock Items” screen listing those products.

3) **Authentication Fixes**
- The app is displaying `auth.name`, `more.title`, `dashboard.todaySummary` instead of translations.  
Fix the i18n key mapping so that UI shows the actual translated text, not the translation keys.
- Ensure user profile displays actual user full name pulled from auth context.
- Fix redirect after signup/login so no more “Something went wrong” screen appears.

4) **Strong Password Requirements**
Implement strong password validation on signup:
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least 1 uppercase letter
- At least 1 lowercase letter
- At least 1 number
- At least 1 special character
Add inline error messages to guide users before submission.

5) **Language System (i18n)**
- Fix the language selector so switching languages actually updates the UI.
- Re-add ALL languages originally included:
  • English  
  • French  
  • Hausa  
  • Yoruba  
  • Igbo  
(restore any removed languages)
- Ensure all pages—including Dashboard, Products, Reports, More menu, Subscription, and Financial Learning—are fully translated.
- Remove hard-coded English strings and replace with translation keys.

6) **Basic Financial Management Learning Page**
- Rebuild the “Financial Learning / Business Education” section.
- Include:
  • What is Cost Price  
  • What is Selling Price  
  • What is Profit  
  • How Inventory Works  
  • Pricing Strategy  
  • Simple exercises  
- Each topic must support full multi-language translation.
- Add this as a visible menu item under “More”.

7) **UI Cleanup**
- Adjust spacing, margins, and alignment across Dashboard, Products, Reports, and More screen.
- Increase MaiCa logo size on login screen (120–140px).
- Ensure theme colors match MaiCa branding (Navy + teal).
- Ensure icons do not overlap or break layout.

8) **General Stability Fixes**
- Remove translation-key placeholders showing on UI.
- Remove any console errors breaking Expo Preview.
- Ensure app runs in Expo Go without crashing.
- Test full user flow: signup → add first product → dashboard → reports → subscription → language change → logout.

When done, list:
- All changed files
- Any required environment variables
